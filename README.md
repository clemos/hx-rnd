== Randomization-related tools for haxe ==
==========================================

Currently there are only 2 classes:
 - rnd.FastRNG - abstract-based fast(very fast) RNG, non-cryptosecure.
 - rnd.FastRNGObj - same as FastRNG, but uses object, so can be 
shared, but works slower(but still very fast).
